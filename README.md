-- Find Files tool --

type in cmd "python findFiles.py"

Step by step 
1) Insert the file extension you are interested in (jpg, txt, png) without the dot
2) Insert the path of the folder you want to search into (it will search intoi the subfolders as well)
3) Insert the path of the folder you want to save the file 
4) Insert 0 if you want only the files in the destination directory you chose or Insert 1 if you want all the file in subdirectories as well

If there is no problems or error you'll see the sentence ( ex: Done. All .json found files copied from "YourSourceDirectory into YourDestinatioinDirectory")
